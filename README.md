### User Stories

As a user, I want to find a meal I can cook with ingredients in my kitchen, so I don't have to think about it myself and/or spend money.

I go to the [Pepper Cake website](https://peppercake.fly.dev).

#### Cases :
1. I fill my ingredients in the search bar. I find a corresponding meal I like. I click on it and get the infos and recipe.
2. I fill my ingredients in the search bar. I don't find a corresponding meal or one that I like. I either fill more ingredients in or click on the suggested meals that contains some of the ingredients I filled.
3. I don't fill my ingredients in the search bar. I directly click on one of the suggested meals that are among the best on the website.
